# Furry Exchange, a marketplace created by furries, for furries!

Based in Southern California, we’re here to support artists, fursuit makers, and creators with a platform designed specifically for the fandom.

Our site is hosted by Luke Spots, a passionate furry, photographer, and videographer who has volunteered at over 10 conventions, helping many furries bring their business visions to life. At Furry Exchange, we’re dedicated to offering a welcoming, easy-to-use marketplace for all buyers and sellers, free from the frustrations often found on other platforms.

Our mission is to provide a reliable and supportive environment where sellers can thrive and buyers can connect with creators who truly understand the community. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to grow, Furry Exchange is here to empower you every step of the way!

## Why Sell on Furry Exchange?

### A Platform by Furries, for Furries
Furry Exchange is a multi-vendor marketplace created with one mission in mind: to help furry creators, makers, and artists thrive—especially in between conventions. Whether you're selling handmade tails, digital commissions, clothing, merchandise, or full fursuits, Furry Exchange is designed to give you a better way to do business.

Think of it like Etsy, but without the frustration.

### ✦ Fair Fees, Real Support
Unlike big-name platforms that take a hefty cut, penalize sellers over shipping costs, or ding you for anything less than a 5-star review, Furry Exchange keeps things simple and fair. We charge a reasonable percentage only when your items sell—no hidden costs, no tricks.

And if you need help? You're not stuck talking to a bot. We're here to support you.

### ✦ Help Setting Up Shop
Need product photos? Trouble listing your items? Just getting started and unsure how to price or present your work? We’ve got you. We offer onboarding assistance to help vendors get up and running, from photoshoots to listing optimization.

You bring the creativity—we’ll help you show it off.

### ✦ Fulfilled by Furry Exchange (Optional)
If you’d rather spend time creating than packing boxes, we offer optional managed e-commerce services. You can ship your inventory to us, and we’ll handle order fulfillment for you. You’ll still run your store—we’ll just take the stress out of shipping.

### ✦ Built by a Fellow Furry Business Owner
Furry Exchange isn’t some faceless corporation. I run a furry-centric business myself, and I’ve been vending at cons and selling online for years. I understand the challenges artists and makers face, and I’ve built this platform to solve them.

This site was made with the fandom in mind—from the design to the policies to the pricing.

### ✦ Free Marketing to Boost Everyone
Every vendor on Furry Exchange benefits from our platform-wide marketing. We run email campaigns and digital ads at no cost to you, promoting the entire site to buyers across the fandom. When one shop shines, we all shine.

### ✦ Let’s Grow Together
Whether you’re a seasoned vendor or just starting out, Furry Exchange is here to help you reach new customers, keep selling between cons, and be part of a platform that truly has your back.

If you’re interested in joining or have questions, we’d love to chat.

### ✦ Make sales. Support the fandom. Grow Together
